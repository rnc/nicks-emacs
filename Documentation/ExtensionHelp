        desktops to be created. Pressing '?' in the Desktop Mode window shows
        the keybinding options. Desktop loading can be disabled permanently in

                NODESK=true emacs
Files
        Font locking on all modes
        Parentheses highlighting
        Smart region selection via Ctrl-Tab


Key Bindings
============
Some keys are only redefined if rnc_load_keys_reset is switched on.

By default these are defined:
C-c C-i         Indent Region
M-<f21>         Undo
M-<cursor-up>   Page up one line
M-<cursor-down> Page down one line
M-<f20>         Resync files
C-<tab>         Intelligent Region Selection
C-,             Circle Buffers Left
C-.             Circle Buffers Right
C->             Circle Buffers Right excluding buffers name '*something*'
C-<             Circle Buffers Left excluding buffers name '*something*'
C-c t           To-do Mode Buffer
C-KeypardAdd    Calculator
C-c C-p         Check Parentheses
C-c C-d         Insert Data And Time
C-Return        Complete Java Code At Point [Only if JDE mode enabled]
M-Return        Quit
C-c C-t         Toggle Printing Line Numbers
F12             Display Desktop [If enabled]


Old:
C-Backspace     was undefined
C-Delete        was backward-kill-word
M-Backspace     was backward-kill-word
M-Delete        was backward-kill-word
Now:
C-Backspace     Backward-kill-word
C-Delete        Forward-kill-word
M-Backspace     Backward-kill-line
M-Delete        Forward-kill-line



If rnc_load_keys_reset
C-x C-z         Same as C-x b



Emacs Hints
===========

Emacs is a relatively expensive process so try not start/stop/start it a lot.

Use new frames for new windows (C-x 5 2) rather starting another Emacs process.

If possible, the modes are defined as autoloads so there is no performance
hit on Emacs.

Type M-x describe-variable [RETURN] rnc_key_bindings [RETURN]
to get a list of keys that have been mapped. Note that not all of these may
have been mapped if rnc_load_keys_reset has not been set.
